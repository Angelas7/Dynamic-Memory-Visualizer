# Memory Allocation Module

# Overview
This module implements dynamic memory allocation techniques used in operating systems. It helps visualize how memory blocks are allocated and deallocated during runtime.

# Allocation Strategies
1. First Fit - Allocates the first block that is large enough.
2. Best Fit - Allocates the smallest available block that fits.
3. Worst Fit - Allocates the largest available block to leave maximum free space.

# Implementation Details
- The program simulates a memory block and processes requesting memory.
- It shows how memory gets fragmented and deallocated.
- The visualization module interacts with this to display memory allocation dynamically.

# Input and Output
- Input: Process memory requests with size requirements.
- Output: Allocated memory blocks and free space visualization.
