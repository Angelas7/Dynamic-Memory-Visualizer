# Visualization Module

# Overview
This module provides a graphical representation of dynamic memory management, including memory allocation and page replacement. It helps users understand how memory is allocated and managed visually.

# Features
  - Memory Allocation Visualization  
  - Shows how memory blocks are allocated and freed dynamically.
  - Highlights fragmentation and utilization.

  -Page Replacement Visualization 
  - Displays how pages are replaced in memory when a page fault occurs.
  - Illustrates different page replacement algorithms in action.

# Working Mechanism
- The module takes memory-related data from the memory allocation and page replacement modules.
- Generates real-time graphical representations.
- Uses color coding to differentiate between allocated, free, and replaced memory sections.

# Implementation Details
- Uses a graphical library (to be decided, e.g., Matplotlib, Pygame, Tkinter).
- Interactive controls to step through the memory management process.
- Provides statistics on memory usage and efficiency.

# Expected Output
- Visual representation of memory allocation and deallocation. 
- Animation of page faults and replacements occurring dynamically.
