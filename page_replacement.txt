Page Replacement module implementation details go here.
# Page Replacement Module

# Overview
This module demonstrates different page replacement algorithms used in operating systems for efficient memory management. It helps visualize how pages are replaced when a page fault occurs.

# Page Replacement Algorithms Implemented
1. FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
   - The oldest page in memory is replaced first.
   - Simple but can lead to high page faults in some cases.

2. LRU (Least Recently Used)  
   - Replaces the page that has not been used for the longest time.
   - More efficient but requires additional tracking.

3. Optimal Page Replacement  
   - Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest time in the future.
   - Theoretically optimal but requires future knowledge.

# Implementation Details
- The program simulates a process requesting pages from memory.
- Tracks page faults and replacements in real-time.
- The visualization module interacts with this to show how pages are replaced dynamically.

# Input and Output
- Input: A sequence of page requests from a process.
- Output: Visualization of page faults and replacements.
